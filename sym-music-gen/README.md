# MIREX 2025 Symbolic Music Generation 

Repo for developing a model for the MIREX 2025 symbolic music generation competition.


## Installation 

I recommend using `uv` for package management. Install it with;

```
curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh
```

Then to install the environment simply run;

```
uv sync
```

At this point you can either activate the created environment (`source .venv/bin/activate`) or prefix commands with `uv run ...`.

There is also a pip `requirements.txt` file.
